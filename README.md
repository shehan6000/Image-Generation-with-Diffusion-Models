# Image-Generation-with-Diffusion-Models
## Overview
The aim of this project is to explore and experiment with image generation using the Stable Diffusion model, particularly focusing on inpainting techniques. This involves using a pre-trained Stable Diffusion model to generate images based on specific prompts and masks, and logging and retrieving results using Comet for experiment tracking.
